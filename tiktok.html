            <!-- Introduction -->
            <h2 class="heading">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="p2">TikTok has changed the game for social media. It is a platform much like Instagram but JUST videos. Many people believe TikTok is brand new, but in actual fact it’s been around for much longer. TikTok actually was once a well known app “Musical.ly” but changed its name to TikTok in August 2018.<br> 
            The brand owner of Musical.ly decided it would be better to merge its community with those of TikTok to gain a better recognition within the industry. The decision was certainly a good one as now TikTok is worth over a whopping 80 BILLION.<br> 
            TikTok is fastly becoming one of the most used APPS on the app store. One of the main reasons is because of its analytics. A user may go onto instagram and receive maybe 4/5k views on their work, but on TikTok, their work is reaching numbers by the millions.</p>
            
            <!-- Registration -->
            <h2 class="heading">Registration</h2>
            <p class="p2">You don’t have to register for TikTok to use the app, although it is recommended that you do so that you can fully enjoy the app as the videos you see will be tailored to your preferences.<br>To register for TikTok, you must download the app from the App Store (for iPhone/iPad) and the Play Store (for Androids). TikTok is also available as a website but you cannot create an account this way.<br> 
            I will show you how to download and register for the TikTok iPhone app.<br>
            Locate the app on the app store and download it so it shows up on your home screen.<br>
            Click on the sign up button and choose how you are going to create your account. I will be using e-mail.<br>
            Enter all details that you are prompted for.<br>
            Start making your TikToks! </p>

            <!-- How to use the app -->
            <h2 class="heading">How to use the App</h2>
            <p class="p2">This is the main nav bar which sits on the bottom of the screen. From here you can access your profile and also use the discover tool to search certain video topics.<br>
            The discover tool brings you to a page which shows trending videos/ hashtags. From here you can browse through many different types of videos from all around the world.<br>
            To find certain videos/ content creators on the app just click on the discover tool and type in a key word. For this example I used education as my key word. From here it brings up top results/ users with education in their name/ videos/ sounds and hashtags.<br>
            I decided to look up some art tutorials. I typed in art into the discover page and popped up thousands of results.
            From here I clicked onto videos and up popped thousands of art tutorials for me to browse through. Once you find a video you like you click into it to watch. From here you can access the video creators page by swiping right and browse through other videos they have. You can also use the tools to the right of the video (shown on right image) to like, comment and share to other people/platforms.<br>
            How to post a Tik Tok<br>
            To create your own Tik Tok you need to tap on the centre tab to enter camera mode. From here you will be brought to a creative space to make a video. You can choose between making it 15 seconds or 60seconds long. On the right side of the screen there is 6 icons.<br>
            Flip: This flips the camera direction<br>
            Speed: Allows you to record your video in slow motion or sped up<br>
            Beauty: This enables a filter that hides blemishes and smooths out your skin<br>
            Filters: This lets you change the color filter of the camera.<br>
            Timer: Set a timer if you want to film something hands-free.<br>
            Flash: This turns the flash on and off.<br>
            After recording the video click next. From here you can add music and different effects to the video. <br>
            From here click done and post to your page!</p>
