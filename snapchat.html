            <!-- Introduction -->
            <h2 class="heading">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="p2">Snapchat is an app that is available on the app store (apple) and the google play store (android). It is a simple app. Once you download it and make an account it is amazing what you can do! You can send and receive videos and photos from your ‘friends’ once you have added them. You can also post to your ‘story’ which is something that all your friends can see. It is kind of like posting a status on Facebook or tweeting on Twitter. You can block certain people from seeing it. You can also make a
            ‘Private’ story which is one where you are in control of who you add to see
            the story. There are also public stories on snapchat and shows. From
            MTV to Beauty Insider, you can watch different mini shows or read
            articles. You can subscribe to certain mini shows or even news stories, so
            you never miss one! You can also chat to people without sending a video
            or picture, just like texting. There are also group-chats on the app in which you can have all your friends in
            one spot to text or snapchat.</p>

            <!-- How to use the app -->
            <h2 class="heading">How to use the App</h2>
            <p class="p2">The most common use of Snapchat is to communicate with friends via image-based messages, but you can
            also communicate by chats. Many people use Snapchat to follow celebrities.<br>
            So the main use of Snapchat like the name suggests is sending messages as images. How this is done is
            when you open up the app you automatically are at the home/ camera screen.<br>
            From here you can take a photo by tapping the big circle which will change the screen to look like this where your given the option to add text, draw, add stickers and how long you want it to last.<br>
            To add text just tap on the T button and you will be able to start typing.<br>
            To add a drawing just select the pen tool.<br>
            To add stickers just select the sticky note and it will give you a bunch of different options.<br>
            If you swipe to the left, you are brought to the chat screen where you can choose individual friends or group chats to talk to. The difference between these chats is in a single one you have the person's name at the top whereas in a group chat you have the names at the bottom which for this image have been covered by emojis.<br>
            If you go to the previously mentioned chat screen and go to the top where it has a chat and pen log you can bring up this page where you can create a new group and add however many of your friends to it as you’d like.<br>
            Now if you go to the right of the home screen you’ll be brought to the discover screen where you can view your friend’s stories which appear at the top and Subscription stories which appear at the below your friends stories and then below that are stories from companies and  other creators that you may also like.To view a story all you have to do is tap it and it will begin to play.</p>
