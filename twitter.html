            <!-- Introduction -->
            <h2 class="heading">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="p2">Twitter is an application that you can download on any android or apple phone through the app/play store for free. Twitter is a social media platform that allows you to post messages known as “tweets”, it allows you to like posts by other users and retweet their posts on your own page. Twitter was founded in 2006 in San Francisco. On twitter you can use the hashtag key before a relevant word, this allows your tweets to be found easier by other users. By clicking on a hashtag in a tweet it brings you to any other tweets that also include that word or phrase. Twitters logo since 2010 is of a white bird on a light blue background. The bird is said to be the “twitter bird” and that’s why the posts are called “tweets”, as that is the sound the bird would make so it makes sense.</p>
            
            <!-- Registration -->
            <h2 class="heading">Registration</h2>
            <p class="p2">Registering an account for twitter is very simple and easy that basically anybody at any age that’s old enough for the application can make an account. All you need is either an email address or a phone number to get started.<br>
            Once you type up twitter on google it will load you up to this page where you can either make an account or sign into an existing account, if the person already had an account they would head straight into twitter and wouldn’t see this page.<br>
            When you press sign up you will be introduced to this page and you have created a username for your account and you also have to either put your email address down or your phone number.<br>
            The reason you have to do either one of them is
            because it will help twitter contact you just in case something happened to your account.<br>
            Once you made your account you will be brought into this screen and depending on which option you picked they will send a code to your email or number and ask you to type it in just to make sure you’re not a bot or fake account.<br>
            After that they will ask you to make a password it can be anything it just has to be at least 6 letters long. After all that is done twitter will ask you to select thing that you are interested in, this will help them find and help you choose on what and who to follow on twitter since it’s your first time on the app.</p>

            <!-- How to use the app -->
            <h2 class="heading">How to use the App</h2>
            <p class="p2">Twitter is a very simple app to use there are only really
            a couple of ways to use twitter.<br>
            The home page is where you will see all the
            tweets from the people you are following you can also post your own tweets on this part of the app.<br>
            The explore page is where you will find all the most popular topics around the internet or as people like to call it “trending” the bigger the topic is trending the higher it will be on the list for example the corona virusis number one trending.<br>
            On twitter you don’t just interact with people by just tweets allow you can direct message them or “DM” for short as well so you can have a full convocation with people you know or other people from around the world it’s a another great way to interact with people.</p>
